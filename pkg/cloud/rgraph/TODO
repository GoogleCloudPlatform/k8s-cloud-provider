TODOs
=====

* DropRef needs to track InRef counts if a resource is referenced more
  than once.

* ParallelExecutor needs to be designed and implemented.

* Resource types need to be completed: TargetHTTPSProxy.

* Implement support for AppNet APIs.

* E2E test for each type that can be run independently to test the
  CRUD, diff, transition and planning.

* Chaos testing of the planner and executor.

* [done] Project ID needs to be plumbed through to the Cloud Provider layer.

* Fill out the testlib/* with all of the different resource trees that
  we can think of.

* Add support for coverage testing in the integration tests (look up
  how to do this in the Godocs)

* Finish action_update.go for the generic update function.

* Check that trclosure is threadsafe for the work items (e.g. Node
  sync). It seems like the Graph lock is sufficient as it gaurrantees
  only one thread is executing the sync at a given time.

* Generic update hasn't been implemented.

* Support injecting errors in Fake resource SyncFromCloud
